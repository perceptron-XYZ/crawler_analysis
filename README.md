# crawler_analysis
It is the course project of COMP354 Software Engineering I. We implemented a small data visualization tool to analyze the data scraped from Google Play in Java.

In order to run this program, you need 4 libraries: <b>jcommons, jfreechart, kxml and xstream</b>.

The app supports two types of analysis, list and chart. 

You have to choose a base element and an aggregate element. For example, 'developers' as base and 'total number of apps' as aggregate will give you the number of apps for each developer. You can also order the result in both orders.
